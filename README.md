The cube chart compares the core causes for study among students of diverse age groups and the number of support they received from employers

According to the first graph, we can clearly see that the percentage of career shows a downward trend with the growing of age, while the proportion of interest witnesses an upward trend, following with age. For career, its figure decreases from 80% under the year of 26 to 18% over 49 years old. By contrast, the percentage of interest rises from 10% under 26 years old, reaching at 41% at the age of 40 to 49, which is the same proportion with that of career.

As we can see from the second chart, the employer support slightly decreases from the age of 0 to about 35 tears old, followed with the percentage rises, up to 40% over 49 year-old.
